## Description

This is my updated Portfolio page that includes projects that I have completed during my time in the bootcamp. The portfolio also contains an about me section and contact information including links to my GitHub and Linkedin profiles. There is also a link to my resume which just brings up a separate HTML file, which you can then return to the main portfolio from if the user chooses to do so.

#### Technologies
