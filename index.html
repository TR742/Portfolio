            <p>Welcome! My name is Tyler Richard and thank you for viewing my portfolio page. I am 29 years old and currently a student working toward becoming a web developer. I live in Gilbert, Arizona along with my beautiful wife and daughter of 7 months. My interests include Arizona sports, music, and spending as much time with my family as possible.<br><br><br>Below you will find links to work that I have personally completed for reference. I am currently learning and growing my skills as a developer and will be adding more content of my work to view soon. I appreciate you taking the time to meet me and I hope you enjoy the page!
